## 1000 Compilers

This repository is meant for documenting and logging what I'm studying/reading/doing that is remotely related to compilers and that stuff. Hopefully, it would be beneficial for anyone that would come across this repo and wanted to dig into compilers. </br>  

1. I have began with the obvious choice for anyone starting to study on his own, which is the amazing book [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/). 
    
    The book is really starting from scratch and doesn't assume any knowledge of compilers and even in programming (maybe a little maturity) and his way of presenting new concepts is really awesome, because it feels like as if he was just like me; beginning to study compilers without any academic background. So he walks you through his understanding process and how he got to understand things (and he really does know his stuff), for example in the chapter talking about parsing algorithms which is super tricky topic, he explained it from the very basic principles and how the functions flow and didn't have to be talking about automata and state machines like other books and correctness proofs and things like that.</br></br>
    I have written the code that comes with the book in `Python` as a way for me to solidify what I was reading and to learn `go` a bit more, here is the [repo](https://github.com/omar-3/Monkey-Compiler).</br></br>
    Now let's go to the next obvious step which is [crafting interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by [munificent](https://github.com/munificent).
